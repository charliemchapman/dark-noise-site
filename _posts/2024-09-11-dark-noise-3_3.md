Dark Noise 3.3 with support for iOS 18 is now released on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395).

From the beginning, Dark Noise has been designed to quickly let users start an ambient soundscape and get back to their life. Deep integrations with iOS such as Shortcuts, home and lock screen widgets, and Siri have all been in service of this goal. Many daily users haven't opened the app completely in months! 

## Control Center Widgets

With iOS 18, Dark Noise is continuing that legacy with support for the new Control Center widgets. Users can now add a widget to their control center to toggle a sound of thier choosing. When adding a widget, they'll be presented with a few configuration options.

Users can optionally set a timer to automatically stop their sound after a certain duration or at a particular time. The long fade option will slowly fade the sound over a long period of time to prevent the sudden stop from waking someone up.
