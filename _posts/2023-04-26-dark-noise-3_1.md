Dark Noise 3.1 was released today with a few highly requested features after the big 3.0 launch earlier this month.

What's New:
* There is a brand new **Green Noise** sound that provides an endless ambient noise in the same frequency ranges as nature.
* A new "Classics" section has been added to the noise selection view with some of the original sounds before they were remastered. This will include sounds that are more dramatically changed whenever a remaster replaces them so that people who prefer the original sound can still use them.
* On iOS, 3 new alternate app icons were added with the original flat icon design called "1.0 Purple", "1.0 Black", and "1.0 White".

Dark Noise 3.1 is available on the App Store to [download for free](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395). Dark Noise Pro is currently available for $2.99 a month, $19.99 a year with a 3 day trial, or a one time purchase for $49.99. Screenshots and promotional material can be found in the updated [press-kit](/press).
