Dark Noise is a delightful ambient noise app designed to be simple to use, with a lot of powerful features under the hood. Each of the 30+ high quality ambient noises feature a custom built animated icon that brings the sound to life.

Let's be honest, an ambient noise app should play your noise and get out of your way as quickly as possible. Dark Noise was designed with this in mind.

Power users will enjoy faster access to Dark Noise with Siri Shortcuts integrations, Today Extension widgets, and home screen quick actions. Dark Noise features over 20 custom home screen icons and has alternate light and pure black themes.
