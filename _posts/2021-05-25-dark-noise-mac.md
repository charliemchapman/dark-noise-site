Dark Noise is coming to the Mac! The sleek UI and large selection of ambient sounds you know and love are now easier than ever to use while you work.

Taking advantage of the Mac platform, a new innovative "adaptive toolbar" UI allows you to shrink your window into a Mini Player to keep Dark Noise quickly accessible while taking up very little screen space. Dark Noise for Mac also features full menu support with keyboard shortcuts to feel right at home on your Mac.

All of your favorite Dark Noise features are here including timers, custom mixes, widgets, and multiple themes. And with iCloud syncing, all of your custom mixes will automatically be available on your Mac.

Dark Noise is available on the App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395) and Dark Noise for Mac will release on Tuesday, May 25th as a universal app including the iPhone and iPad versions. Existing Dark Noise customers will be able to download Dark Noise for Mac for free.
