Dark Noise 3.2 for the Mac releases Tuesday, September 26th with support for macOS Sonoma and all new interactive widgets.

Dark Noise widgets have been rebuilt from the ground up to support the all new interactive widgets in macOS Sonoma. This means you can start and stop a sound right from your widget in Notification Center or from your desktop without needing to open the app.

There are now 9 different widget's to choose from, each with 12 themes you can configure between. The all new Now Playing widget, built specifically for the Mac (but coming to iOS now as well) brings quick access to play, pause, and skip through your favorite sounds.
