If you have purchased Dark Noise from the App Store on one device but are not able to download the app from the App Store on a separate iPhone, iPad, or Mac you can try a few things to solve the issue.

1. Ensure you are logged into the same iCloud account on the new device as you used to purchase the app originally.
2. Restart your device (annoying I know but I have heard from some folks that this has fixed the issue).
3. Wait. Unfortunately the App Store seems to sometimes have issues with syncing purchases. After a few hours (sometimes even a couple days) these issues usually resolve themselves.
