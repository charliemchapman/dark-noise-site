Unfortunately Dark Noise does not currently support sharing custom mixes natively. It is a frequently requested feature so it is on my roadmap, but there are some infrastructure changes I need to make to make that possible first.

For now you can take screenshots of your mix and share it for others to replicate themselves in the app.
