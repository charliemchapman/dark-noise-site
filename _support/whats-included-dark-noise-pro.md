I've you are installing Dark Noise on a new device, you may need to restore a previous purchase.
* Tap the gear icon to open settings.
* Tap the "Dark Noise Pro" banner at the top of settings.
* Tap the "Restore" button on the bottom right.

**Note:** If you purchased Dark Noise directly from the App Store before the 3.0 update that made Dark Noise free to try, you should automatically become a [Dark Original](./dark-originals.md) with all sounds and original features unlocked.
