If you purchased Dark Noise directly from the App Store before the 3.0 update that made Dark Noise free to try, you should automatically become a "Dark Original" with all sounds and original features unlocked.

Currently, "Dark Originals" will have all of the same features as Dark Noise Pro subscribers. There may, however, be features added in the future that are exclusive to Dark Noise Pro subscribers. If you want to upgrade from a "Dark Original" to Dark Noise Pro you can:
1. Tap the gear icon to open settings.
2. Scroll to the bottom of settings 
3. In the "Dark Noise Original" section, tap the "Subscribe Anyway" button

If you believe you should be a "Dark Original" but do not see it in your app, please don't hesitate to email me at [charlie@darknoise.app](mailto:charlie@darknoise.app).
